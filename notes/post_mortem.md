## Elekta

The issues they are having are not directly your fault. Do not feel bad you did the best you could and your decisions were vetted by the SAs
### Good
- Explored additional avenues to inreasing ability of the pricing script
- Customer was initially pleased
- Dream Team

### Bad
- Requirements got out of hand
- Not perscriptive [Didn't guide the customer on what functionality to include and what to dumb down]
- Requirements were too complicated
- Too willing to please
  - This is a problem I have, need to know what is better for the customer and fight for it
- Lack of confidence

- Lack of knowledge of how current pricing scripts were working


## Takeaways

  - Almost as much as the team matters
  - You are smart and have an incredible ability to learn, have faith in yourself
- Define requirements and stick with them
  - IF something is not working, change it, but document the change thoroughly and double check timelines
