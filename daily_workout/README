Impl details
	- use local storage for now to store statistics
	- use canvas for graphs
	- look into using backbone for models/views/routes
	- will be hosted on github because there is currently no plans to persist data past local storage
		- If plans change on persisting data, break out into new project and change backend to mongo

Models - @WIP will most likely change based on needs
